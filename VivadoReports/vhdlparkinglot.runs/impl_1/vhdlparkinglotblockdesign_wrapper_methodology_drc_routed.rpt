2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_IBUF_inst/O, vhdlparkinglotblockdesign_i/clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin vhdlparkinglotblockdesign_i/ParkingFSM_0/inst/FSM_sequential_NXT_ST_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin vhdlparkinglotblockdesign_i/ParkingFSM_0/inst/FSM_sequential_NXT_ST_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin vhdlparkinglotblockdesign_i/ParkingFSM_0/inst/FSM_sequential_PRES_ST_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin vhdlparkinglotblockdesign_i/ParkingFSM_0/inst/FSM_sequential_PRES_ST_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch vhdlparkinglotblockdesign_i/ParkingFSM_0/inst/count_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin vhdlparkinglotblockdesign_i/ParkingFSM_0/inst/count_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch vhdlparkinglotblockdesign_i/ParkingFSM_0/inst/count_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin vhdlparkinglotblockdesign_i/ParkingFSM_0/inst/count_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch vhdlparkinglotblockdesign_i/ParkingFSM_0/inst/count_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin vhdlparkinglotblockdesign_i/ParkingFSM_0/inst/count_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch vhdlparkinglotblockdesign_i/ParkingFSM_0/inst/count_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin vhdlparkinglotblockdesign_i/ParkingFSM_0/inst/count_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch vhdlparkinglotblockdesign_i/ParkingFSM_0/inst/count_reg[4] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin vhdlparkinglotblockdesign_i/ParkingFSM_0/inst/count_reg[4]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
